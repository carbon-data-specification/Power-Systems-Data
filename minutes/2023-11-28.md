## Agenda
- Discussion around formalizing the spec

## Notes
- [Document to help with language](https://jtc1info.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SD-9-Guide-to-the-Transposition-of-PAS-2021.pdf)
- [Software to help with formalizing to ISO](https://www.metanorma.org/)

The spec itself is meant to describe as plainly and matter-of-factly what this thing does.
Question to ask about each sentence: Is this sentence telling someone to do something, for clarification, a note.

- Normative - this is required
- Non-normative - this is optional, this is where you could extend the spec
- Notes - things to bear in mind

Sections:

- Foreword: material: license, intro, etc
- Glossary/definitions/terms
- Actual meat of it
- Appendices for longer notes, sample

- ISO: what must a person to do to comply and nothing more
- AIB is a transitive reference. For the purposes of this spec we wrote the definitions. We think it should be shared, and AIB is what we're using.

    
## Action Items
   - Stephen: Update the spec to distinguish between normative and non-normative text.
