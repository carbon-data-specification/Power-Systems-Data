## Attendees
- Stephen Suffiain - WattCarbon
- Andre Bernal Garcia - External Collaborator
- Henry Richardson - WattTime
- Jon-Egil Nordvik - ENTSO-E
- Kristina Stanford - Apple

## Agenda
### Spec 1
- Henry
  - What goes in the spec vs what is context? For example LEED spec is very specific and then has a "guidance document" that contains edge cases.
  - Do we copy definitions or do we need to only reference them in other documents?
- Jon-Egil
  - Copying definitions requires having to update when the previous versions are updated
- Henry
   - Guidance documents outside the spec can be outdated with much lower stakes than the spec being outdated

### Spec 2:
 - Jon
   - Reference ISO/European Market Profiles and their definitions rather than create our own enumerations for fuel types/variables
   - Here you'll find the enumerations used in the ESMP documents, among the the fuel types: https://www.entsoe.eu/Documents/EDI/Library/CodelistV88.zip
- Andre
 - Do we need to specify granularity levels for this table?
- Henry
  - They were meant to be minimum requirements
- Agreement to rename the column to "Maximum Locational Granularity"

### Website:
- Henry
  - There is a 3rd use case we need to include


### Steering Comittee Talkback
 - Andre
   - We presented what we have done
   - There might be some elections at the LFESS and LF-Energy level
   - Working Group Level: 
      - after summit, try to get more member recruiting and more stakeholders

### API Demonstrator
- Andre
   - Did we agree on a new GridNode name?
- Using CIM term PowerSystemResource now.

### Action Items

- Ask LF-Energy folks what goes in the spec vs what is context. (HR)
