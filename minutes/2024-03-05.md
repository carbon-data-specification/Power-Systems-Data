## Notes

Alex introduced himself to the group, providing context on CDSC and the Power Systems WG. Alex also talked about the next steps in making the specification better recongized and leveraged in industry.

There were some questions on how to enable the community to drive the spec. Alex shared that the spec is in a state where it's just about ready to go public with, and once released getting key groups back engaged to drive more consensus and business value will be the next steps in driving community growth. Alex indicated community growth is an area he can help support and drive. Alex further advised the group to not worry about it being perfect, but get the spec to a place for other stakeholders to get involved.

John then worked with the group to resolve some of the outstanding comments in the latest draft.
