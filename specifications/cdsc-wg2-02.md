## Introduction <a id="introduction" href="#introduction" class="permalink">üîó</a>
This specification was developed as part of the global effort to combat the climate crisis. Specifically, in order to scalably measure carbon emissions of organizations and calculate the impact of deploying and operating clean energy technologies, companies need an efficient means to discover the details and capabilities of energy utilities and other similar entities.

This specification offers a topological graph model of electricity grids that has been defined by this working group, which is to be used for subsequent specifications. This specification is intended to be a starting point for defining the necessary terms of structure for developing a data streaming specification.

### 3. Entities<a id="entities" href="#entities" class="permalink">üîó</a>

We propose to define data types for three different kinds of entities. These entities would all be defined as nodes in the topology graph described in `CDSC-WG2-01`. The three kinds of entities are:

* <b>System</b>. A system is the lowest granularity level in the topology graph. It is a collection of other entities. A system can for example be a single synchronous grid, or a collection of synchronous grids. A <b>System</b> SHOULD represent Granularity Levels 0,1,2 defined by `CDSC-WG2-01`.
* <b>Market</b>. A market is a collection of nodes that are connected to each other through a single market operator. A market can for example be a single balancing area, or a collection of balancing areas. A <b>Market</b> SHOULD represent Granularity Levels 3 defined by `CDSC-WG2-01`
* <b>Unit</b>. A unit is a single physical entity. A unit can for example be a single power plant, or a single generation unit within that plant. A <b>Unit</b> SHOULD represent Granularity Levels 4,5 defined by `CDSC-WG2-01`.

#### Secondary  Information
This is information that will be included as part of one of the rows above.
- Generation by fuel type: The full breakdown of generation per fuel type (e.g. wind, solar), based on the Fuel Type and Generation Technologies defined below.

### Other Entities <a id="entities--other-entities" href="#entities--other-entities" class="permalink">üîó</a>
Some data types are defined for multiple variables. For example, emissions can be reported for multiple pollutants, or production can be reported for multiple fuel types.

In these cases, the data type is defined once, and we specify henceforth that the data type is a variable. The variables SHOULD be defined as follows in order to attempt to standardize naming conventions for similar fuel types. This is not an exhaustive list however, and each entity MAY provide a means for defining additional types.
