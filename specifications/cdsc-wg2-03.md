## 2. Introduction <a id="introduction" href="#introduction" class="permalink">üîó</a>
This specification was developed as part of the global effort to combat the climate crisis. Specifically, in order to scalably measure carbon emissions of organizations and calculate the impact of deploying and operating clean energy technologies, companies need an efficient means to discover the details and capabilities of energy utilities and other similar entities.

This specification offers a specification for a set of endpoints that would contain the necessary information for carbon data calculations.
