# Power Systems Data Working Group

This repository is dedicated to the [Power Systems Data Working Group](https://powersystemsdata.carbondataspec.org/).

## Goal

> The Power Systems Data Working Group aims to define an open specification for raw electric power system data to facilitate a systematic and more accurate approach to report grid emissions.

The full scope is described in the [Scope](2_Scope.md) section.

## Get Started

ðŸ‘‹ We are always open to welcoming new contributors! ðŸ‘‹

You can get involved in a number of ways. We gather contributors that bring technical expertise, contributors that are consumers of power systems data, as well as contributors that want to push for open data in the power sector.

A good place to start is to look at our website: [https://powersystemsdata.carbondataspec.org/](https://powersystemsdata.carbondataspec.org/).

## Specifications

* [CDSC-WG2-01 - Grid Topologies](https://powersystemsdata.carbondataspec.org/specs/cdsc-wg2-01/)
* [CDSC-WG2-02 - Data types](https://powersystemsdata.carbondataspec.org/specs/cdsc-wg2-02/)
* [CDSC-WG2-03 - API Interface](https://powersystemsdata.carbondataspec.org/specs/cdsc-wg2-03/)

`CDSC-WG2-01 - Grid Topologies` is used to develop a shared terminology for various levels of granularity of grid entities and a convention for describing how those entities relate to each other. `CDSC-WG2-02 - Data Types` describes consensus around data fields that are either required or recommended in order to adequately describe the state of various grid entities. These two specifications are used in the development of `CDSC-WG2-03 - API Interface`, which describes an interface for power systems operators when sharing power system data. 

### Join the Working Group
