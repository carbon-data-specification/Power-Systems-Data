# Power Systems Data Working Group (WG2)

This is the homepage of the [Power Systems Data Working Group (WG2)](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Power-Systems-Data),
part of the
[Carbon Data Specification Consortium (CDSC)](https://www.lfenergy.org/projects/carbon-data-specification-cds/),
an [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) project.

## Scope

__An open specification for raw electric power system data to facilitate a systematic and more accurate approach to report grid emissions.__

This working group focuses on creating a unified specification for data retrieved from power system operators.

Power system data might include, but is not limited to:

* Generation mix
* Power imports and exports
* Power market data
* Delivery capacities and/or constraints
* Power generation emissions

This common standard shall enable grid decarbonisation pathways and decision-making. By aligning the definition of the data shared by power system operators, this specification will make it easier for third parties to consistently compute (using their own carbon models) and report grid emissions worldwide.

## Use Cases

* [Carbon accounting]({{ "/use-cases/#use-case-carbon-accounting" | relative_url }})
* [Consumption optimisation]({{ "/use-cases/#use-case-consumption-optimisation" | relative_url }})
* [Renewable Project Siting]({{ "/use-cases/#use-case-renewable-siting" | relative_url }})

## Specifications

These are the official [specifications]({{ "/specs" | relative_url }}) written by this working group.
